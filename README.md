### Automatidata: NYC Taxi Fare Estimator

#### Overview

In this project, I developed an application for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) to enable riders to estimate taxi fares in advance. The project spanned six comprehensive parts, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis and machine learning.

#### Key Features

- **Project Proposal:** Defined the fare estimation app's scope, milestones, and tasks.
- **Data Understanding:** Identified necessary datasets and explored key variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Cleaned and visualized data to uncover patterns.
- **Statistical Testing:** Conducted hypothesis testing to validate data assumptions.
- **Regression Models:** Built and evaluated regression models to predict fare amounts.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Developed machine learning models to predict tipping behavior.

#### Highlights

- **Model Performance:** Achieved high accuracy and reliability in fare and tip prediction.
- **Data Insights:** Identified key factors influencing fare and tipping behavior.
- **Business Impact:** Provided actionable insights for improving driver service strategies.
