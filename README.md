In this project, which was a part of the [Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics)
, I developed an application for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) to enable riders to estimate taxi fares in advance. The project spanned six comprehensive parts, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis and machine learning.

#### Key Features

- **Project Proposal:** Defined the fare estimation app's scope, milestones, and tasks.
- **Data Understanding:** Identified necessary datasets and explored key variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Cleaned and visualized data to uncover patterns.
- **Statistical Testing:** Conducted hypothesis testing to validate data assumptions.
- **Regression Models:** Built and evaluated regression models to predict fare amounts.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Developed machine learning models to predict tipping behavior.

#### Highlights

- **Model Performance:** Achieved high accuracy and reliability in fare and tip prediction. 
- **Data Insights:** Identified key factors influencing fare and tipping behavior.
- **Business Impact:** Provided actionable insights for improving driver service strategies.

![Translation](assets/img/Machine Translation.png)

In this project, which was the last section of the NLP specialization with classification and vector spaces authorized by DeepLearning.AI, I implemented and developed a machine translation system to translate English words to French using word embeddings and vector space models. The project involved the following key steps:

1. **Generated embedding and transformation matrices for English and French words**

2. **Implemented a linear transformation to convert English word embeddings to French embeddings.**
    
3. **Minimized the translation error by computing and optimizing a transformation matrix using the Frobenius norm loss function.**

3. **Achieved a `56% accuracy` on Unseen Data by using some basic linear algebra and learning a mapping of words from one language to another.**
  
4. **Applied Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to perform an efficient document search and find similar tweets for Document Search.**
